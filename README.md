# Word Guessing Game

A beginner-friendly word guessing game built using Python. This game demonstrates the use of basic Python concepts such as strings, loops, conditionals, and the `random` module.

## ðŸŽ® Game Description

- The program randomly selects a word from a predefined list.
- The user has 12 chances to guess the word one letter at a time.
- Correct guesses reveal the letter in its correct position.
- Incorrect guesses reduce the number of remaining turns.
- The game ends when the user either guesses the entire word or runs out of turns.

## ðŸ§  Concepts Used

- `input()` for user interaction
- `random.choice()` to select a word
- `while` loop for the game flow
- String concatenation and conditionals (`if/else`)
